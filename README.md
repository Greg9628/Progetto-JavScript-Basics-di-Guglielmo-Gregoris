# Project Title

Project JavaScript basics - Guglielmo Gregoris

## Description

* I created a simple counter to increase a number by one, both positive and negative integers. Starting from 0.
* First of all I thought about the design of the counter so I searched the internet for the templates I liked best to get inspiration in order to build my site in the best possible way.

* I thought of putting the button in the center so that the user can see it right away and that it makes sense in terms of UX design.

* To create the functions of the counter I used JavaScript more specifically I created three constant variables that took as 'id' minus, the plus (+ and -) and the counter. Inside the variables I have inserted the document.querySelector method to select the HTML id.

* Then I created a function with the addEventListenere method where a counter is activated when the cursor is clicked, if it is the most the counter increases the value by one, otherwise it decreases it.
